# Creating an OwlO Library User

Navigate to OwlO Library when opening up the website, and select the "Register" button at the navigation bar.

Enter in your credentials, and click "Submit & Register".


**ALERT: Document Scanning UNAVAILABLE as secret key used is DISABLED. **

The document scanning feature is done by uploading a personal document like a resume, and Google Visions will make use of Object Character Recognition to grab every word in said document. Google Languages is then used to filter out the necessary information to be inputted like the person's email, name, any interesting information to be placed in the bio, and NRIC(if available). 

The whole process would take less than 10 seconds, which is extremely efficient and fast for the person registering.

**Creating a user is important to make use of other features in the website like voucher redemption at the Owl Shop.**

# Using the Chat Bot

The Chat Bot widget is avaialble **ANYWHERE** in the OwlO Library website, and can be accessed by clicking the circled icon at the bottom right of any page.

The Chat Bot is a quick and easy way to get around the website and to different parts of the entire OwlO platform like going to OwlO Plan and OwlO Workshop. It can also answer questions about volunteering as a whole or about the website. It serves as a digital assistant to people who are too busy to learn the ins and outs of the platform, and also for the elderly who are not technologically proficient so it would be a makeshift "friend" that would help them in their journey to access the site.

The bot is powered by Google Dialogflow, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) platform that can be used to build conversational applications and experiences for the user.

An **INTENT** would have to be created in the Dialogflow Console at Google Cloud, and this would serve as the "Q&A" portion of the chat bot.

An Intent consists of Training Phrases which are example phrases for what end-users might type or say. For example, if a training phrase of "where to register" is added, it  trains the bot to recognize end-user expressions that are similar to that phrase, like "i need to register" and more. The more training phrases, the better-trained the bot will be and it is recommended to at least have 5 training phrases per intent.

An intent also consists of the response which is the "answer". If there is more than 1 response, the bot will randomize which one to send out.
