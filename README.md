# Introductions

Welcome to our github repository, here you will find our source code, some simple instructions and brief description of each of the team members features.
OWLO is an ambitious project that is put together by, Azfar, Danish, Gabriel, Jing Kai and Nuzul. You may find more elaboration on the project through our slides, project report or even the demo markdown for each of our parts.

# Getting Started
---
In order to succesfully run our application, please do the following. 

#### Step 1: Run migrations  
#### Step 2: Copy sql scripts to update databases


# Features
---
Since OWLO is a big application with many application it is unwise to fit all of them in 1 single readme. Hence, we have split our the instructions into seperate readme so that you can run the demo with ease.
