### C. Explore Projects
The developers here at OWLO understands that not all volunteers have the energy to manage a project let alone a team. Most often than not, people may find it to be more comfortable to have other more talented people to lead the project. Hence, OWLO is dedicated to also providing a seamless experience in joining a project. To do so, a user will need to first find a project that matches their interests. Then, go on the explore projects page and select a cause they would like to browse through. After, the user can browse through the projects that is listed in that specific cause. 

When a project listing manage to attract the users attention, the user may either quickly join a project or view the project details. 
When in the join project page the user is encouraged to input a simple introduction, reasons to join and feedback if there are any. After, the project members will see a new entry in the application section of the project management page. The members can decide to whether accept or deny the request to join. 

+CRD Join Request/Application

### D. Invite Volunteers
An existing project member may find that they have friends or family that is suitable for the project and hence can directly invite them to join the project. To do so, the member will need to search for the user in the Explore volunteer section. After that the member can invite the user in a project that he/her isn't already inside.
